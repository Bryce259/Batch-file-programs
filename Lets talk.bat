@echo You guys, what's up? Oh boy, don't we have things to say here. So, lately when I've done was copied a bunch of text from anywhere, which sometimes if you paste it somewhere, it would probably make the phone freeze. Like for example you have something else pasted and it will say copied the pasteboard at the end. I would send it over message to people and they want to stay there, would either lag. I tried posting something very long to google plus, but before it was about ready to be available, the page of the fresh, which was crazy. My next experiment is what would happen if that was something we text on the computer? That would be an experiment. Sometimes, it even makes VoiceOver glitch, and I have to turn voiceover off because even when I turn speech on speech, and there's no other choice but to turn it off and turn it back on. Otherwise, you could turn off your phone, but I wouldn't do that because it would be not good because then I'd have to turn back on. That's why I don't do that. This is why when I do it, I always just turn voiceover off and back on, because sometimes I can do it a lot and then it would be a lag, and sometimes if you're reading your message that you sent the message you were somewhere, the phone or voiceover might lag or 10 seconds, or maybe less. Then it would read what you read. Well, it kind of depends. If you pasted in a bunch of characters, your phone probably would not be able to handle that many characters that you have, so then it would just go nuts.
pause
echo Who knows what could happen next. Another theory I'm trying to do is to see what would happen if you pasted a lot of stuff into Google docs and shared it and went on Google.com using Safari and see if the webpage would reload or even crash the app.
pause
echo That would be a good experiment. What I would try to do is make a document, no matter if it's a word document, then import it to Google Docs and share it. Then, I would open Safari. I haven't done this all yet, but hopefully it will work. It would kind of be a different kind of experiment with something like that to try. Well, I guess is this is the start of something new. But I think I've done this before, so not really.
pause
echo Well, maybe but not sure. But, this might be cool. Because one time I pasted a hell of a lot of text so I can posted to google plus, and after I clicked on post, the webpage actually reloaded. I would think that if you came to the CAC it would probably make the app lag or something like that, but no it actually never posted. But it's probably expected but it would reload like that since it's a hell of a load of text. So, whatever. All you have to do is keep copying the same exact text until it's about done, then paste it somewhere, and who knows what might happen. Also, one time Dane said that his voice over using the Samantha voice flagged, which is pretty much expected because there's also many texts in there, so what do you expect? I would expect it to do that.
pause
echo Wouldn't you? Also, another time I tried sending a lot of it, and the messages that actually crash! Go when I was going to text someone else, it took a while for the message field to actually respond so you could type something due to a crash in earlier, which is quite nuts. That my folks is quite the craziest thing you've heard so far my bed. Also, after I pasted the hell kind of text, the app actually would freeze for about 1/2 minutes, then it might even crash, then you'd have to open the app again. Yeah, that's how bad it actually was, not to mention the crashing and all that other crazy nonsense. Oh boy. My thought is, I wonder what would happen if you had so much text or it was lagging so much that it glitched to the point of your screen locking, or your phone restarting itself. In that case, it probably won't happen since that's pretty much crazy at this point. You have to enter so much text, or copy and paste that much work to do that. Good luck if it works, because it might not be so good for you.
pause
echo It might turn bad. So, that's the whole story about that. This next experiment I might try is creating a word document or maybe just any document and saving it to one drive or something, then open it up and see what the computer react or how it reacts to so much of that tax document. It'll probably take 10 seconds to load it if I had to guess or predict that. Not sure though, as I haven't really tried it at all, but it's probably will be something to try next in the list. I actually what without knowing what would happen if I copied and paste it so much text on from Texas beach.com website, and see if the Safari app crashes or the page reloads or refreshes or something like that. It will probably take forever to try to download the file from there, because there's so many text you can have on there that I'm sure it would not work. I actually now have 32 subscribers on YouTube, and 229 videos. I actually received 32 subscribers only two days, Wednesday and Thursday. The first subscriber I got was on the Wednesday which is how I got 31 subscribers, then like at midnight I got like 32 subscribers, because I looked at an email notification about it, I don't know who would be subscribing to people that late but who knows. Looks like definitely we are growing guys. Yes, we are. Also, another thing is that I've been on YouTube for over a year, which is a good thing that I've been on there for that long making stuff. Also, Wednesday I made another episode like talk show, except I was live so it would be cool to see it live. After I was done live streaming, here are some weird thing that I noticed happened in the end of the live stream. OK, so I ended the live stream before I went downstairs, and then in the evening when I was in bed, I checked to see how the live stream turned out. However it still showed up with life, in which I was not. Then, Thursday I was able to play. Heck, I don't know really what happened, although I only know that it did that weird thing. And of course, it also showed that it was off-line, which is true. But I don't know why it wasn't archive yet, because it was like five hours ago that day since I streamed it, end it should have already been processed after I was done live streaming video. However, it was doing something completely different than what it was supposed to do, so I thought I would have to remove the video or do something about it if it wasn't going to work, but then Thursday I checked and I noticed, it actually is good now. Then, I was thinking what happened? I wasn't sure, so that's why I thought that. I thought there must be some ashore something. But then on Thursday, I check for the live stream and apparently works now. Who knows what the problem was, but luckily we fixed it. Also, speaking of problems, wait till I tell you the story about iMovie. I'll tell you the story. On Thursday, I created a slideshow kind a like the one I did in August where I made a slideshow with all kinds of photos that I took in some say from the Internet. It's nine minutes and 30 seconds long. Well, I was going to upload the video to YouTube as I was going to share it. Who knows what went on, but let me tell you the problems that I had when it was uploading to YouTube. I was going to upload the video to YouTube as I was going to Scherret. Who knows what went on, but let me tell you the problems that I had when it was uploading to YouTube. Well, it would never make it on YouTube. The reason for that is because when I uploaded it to YouTube, it said failed to upload to YouTube. Seriously, what is going on nowadays? The next plan was to export the video to my camera so I could upload it using the YouTube app or something. Then it said on our occurred during export. I wasn't sure why it was doing that, but it did. Just for that, I will show you all proof that this happened, because I took screenshots of the errors that came up whenever I would try to do it.

Seriously, why in the world what it do this? It should be doing job, not just screwing around like some idiot. Also, let me tell you another thing. On Friday I was doing a video of me playing with my flying disc resume toy. This time I wanted to see what would happen if I made this video with iMovie to see if it would actually upload. This time it was 13 minutes long. When I uploaded the video, it actually was able to upload a video for once, which was surprising. I don't know why the other video I tried to upload with it it would never go through, but then now it was not going to work when I did my slideshow video. Now, Saturday I tried uploading the same slideshow video, and guess what? The same thing happened! It wasn't going to upload or export to my photo library at all, which is stupid really. I don't know why, but it is stupid. Seriously, there should be no problem putting the video out there. I think what Apple good kind of screwed with the app kind of, because some videos don't make it to YouTube when you upload them. Luckily the one I did on Friday was able to go on there, or else I would have to go in Splice and combine videos and upload it there. Video only took about more than 15 minutes to upload on Friday, in the slideshow video, well, it would take longer but it actually never get it. There should be no problem uploading all the stuff in there, so I don't know the problem behind it. Hopefully I'll be able to share it sometime, but who really knows. I hope it isn't the Wi-Fi, because when I did the video on Friday it uploaded just well with no problems at all. So, I want to know why it's doing this all the sudden. It should be good instead of doing what it wants. There should be no problem uploading all the stuff in there, so I don't know the problem behind it. Hopefully I'll be able to share it sometime, but who really knows. I hope it isn't the Wi-Fi, because when I did the video on Friday it uploaded just well with no problems at all. So, I want to know why it's doing this all the sudden. It should be good instead of doing what it wants. Sometimes the Wi-Fi router is pretty good, but it probably is something different from what I know, maybe a different problem. As you know, Apple has been updating the app, and I don't know if that's half of the problem of that because it might be the problem but I do not know exactly. Hopefully it's not a problem, but I'm gonna have to tell them the reviews on the App Store saying the problem happened. Hopefully the lazy butt to work on it. They better. Also, let's get to the subject about audio. In some cases, when I record audio with the voice memos, it might be likely that I would upload some of those recordings somewhere else, like OneDrive or something, just case I can also use the recordings on the computer, or a different phone. This could also be useful as well, because if I don't have another phone that has all the recordings, then it's already uploaded to their, so you wouldn't need to worry about it because you arty have it saved in the cloud. Yeah, smart idea right? I know. I have a few recordings that I've made, and I have some saved on there for this year, last year. Also on the iPhone 6s, recordings I made into thousand 16 rolls with me as well, but not all of them, which is bad. Also, it kind of stinks because some recordings are quite funny. Well, I wouldn't save every single recording, as I don't do that because it would probably take up too much storage away. But funny recordings like me and Drew bouncing the ball knocking things down it's quite funny. I have some recordings on my iPhone 7 of me and Drew doing that on Thanksgiving, but the one two years ago, couldn't be even more funny. Actually that with 2015 and 2016 after Thanksgiving, and one time me and Drew play the ball before Christmas. Boy, was that funny. We would laugh every time it would do something, and if I have my old phone I'll probably log into my cloud storage software like one drive or something so I could upload those recordings but, since I don't have that I can't do that. Goddamnit sun of a bitch piece of shit motherfucking asshole fuck fuck fuck
Seriously, it was quite funny. Hey, when I said those crazy words, that's what Microsoft Sam likes to say when he gets mad or something. XD. Also the old recordings I had on my old phone with me and papa telling stories, luckily I have some of them still saved from the cloud from when I uploaded the recordings to sugar thing, which is where I uploaded all my other recordings to so I could use it and also my grade it to one drive to. There was a recording that I also saved of us at Hollywood studios which is in Walt Disney in Florida. I've got recording was quite long ago, but it was good. I was getting full on storage on OneDrive Because it's pretty much getting too full, and it kind of still live all. Before I remove the recording, I saved it in iCloud Drive, so I could still look at it. Sometimes I create it and sometimes I'll share some recording is there, just so if I can't share it on there or shirt on iCloud Drive instead just in case it can't be shared anywhere else. That way I'll still be able to look at it in iCloud Drive, which is also good. Not only good for when I get a new phone and I don't have the recordings, but also it can be useful if I don't have the recordings on Voice Memos anymore if I will removing some recordings. That way, I can still view it because I have it saved in the cloud. That's why it's useful if I do that, and I can always listen to on the computer to, since I listen to them on the computer most of the time. Also, I also created a folder on OneDrive called Voice Memos. Before I did not have that folder, but close to the end of the year of 2017, I decided instead of having all my recordings with all my other files, I could create a separate folder where the can all stay in, so they have that place to be in. It could also be a good name for all of her cloud storage software like iCloud drive or any other place, in which they would be able to stay. I think the best place to put all of those recordings this is one called MediaFire, since a lot of my recordings her big size, and on MediaFire you get more storage, so it would be a better place to stay. That way, you won't have to worry about removing them or trying to choose which one to remove a lot. I know you have to think of something to remove in the future, but it will take a while because of that software having really good storage. Like I told you, the storage there is phenomenal since you get 10 GB, which like I said there are not many cloud storage providers that offer that amount of storage at all, because either they're all 5 GB, because it seems like all cloud storage providers all get 5 GB, even iCloud does that. It's pretty common for them all to give you that amount, since there are a lot of software that give you that amount. That's why I say, there is not a lot of people that give 10 to 12 3 GB at all, in that case it's true because no one else like they're does that at all, probably because they don't even know what the heck they're doing. Really, who knows exactly. By the way, I will MediaFire since the end of July, adding a lot of things like photos and videos all software, maybe things that I've downloaded. Most of the time I share things to google plus, and sometimes the files could be music, photos or videos, or even software that I've downloaded from somewhere else but I put it on MediaFire. Some of them get a lot of downloads, and some gold. If I didn't shirt for anyone then I wouldn't get any downloads in less I downloaded it on my computer, but that would only be one download. Sometimes if I make a link to an audio recording or something I might text the person the link. If I think there will be a good file that I think everyone might be interested in downloading, like our YouTube converted video that includes music, or videos or maybe software, then I might share it on somewhere like Google plus or something. Why? Because there might be something people are interested in trying. I'll give you want to be examples. One of the examples is that yesterday I downloaded a program called virtual studio code, which would instantly wedding program and application with extensions and all kinds of stuff. Well, I save the file and then I uploaded it to MediaFire, and posted it to Google plus. I have not checked to see how many downloads the file has yet, but later today I will check to see how many downloads the file has reached so far. Another good example is, when I went to the YouTube creator Academy, I found a little PDF that the creators their posted. It was a little thing about how people can be discovered, and all the fall about how people can discover you on YouTube. PDF explain to you everything you need to know about discovery, and how many people can discover you and how you can get noticed on the Internet. Since I still have that file I thought I might as will upload that file, and from five figure many people have YouTube account, I am I would like to see that. So then, what did I do next what? I uploaded the file, and shared it. Currently have 16 downloads. Also, what I made a video called tips on how to grow your YouTube channel, the things I put in the description was the link to that PDF. So, now that I added the link to the PDF, everyone will be able to download it, as it's now available to the public because I put the link in the description of this file. If I get insurance anything, then no one would be able to know it anyway because they haven't seen it. Here's another example. Along time ago I downloaded the Cepstral David, which is also a computer voice. Originally downloaded the file from dropbox, because apparently someone had put it on there, and do a video with the link in the description so people could download it. Well, of course as you know, I downloaded it. It's an MSI file. Then, I uploaded it to MediaFire, and showed it to a Google plus community. I also explained everything that needed to know about installing in the license information. I currently have a valid license for the voice, I put in the license information such as the name and company, and the license key that they would need to use for it. I believe that has 15 downloads on it since I checked yesterday, but I'll have to go back. I also received a comment from somebody saying that at work, so that's good. However, the same person said that they didn't hear anything about his license, which I need to reply to that person and give them the information about that, because you have to do that. If you use the voice without any license, voice will say this. This voice is not licensed. Please visit www.cepstral.com can purchase a license. And some user already have a license, this is a gave all the information. Then, I save it in though, so that way whenever I would go to iCloud information, so that way I would still be able to use it. Another example, I still had a file of a file called Adobe flash, but I guess it was an updated version of Adobe flash player. When I put it on MediaFire and put it on Google plus, apparently no one downloaded it. That's surprising, because all the other files that I shared on there had a lot of downloads, which again is surprising. I guess many people weren't interested in updating Adobe flash player. Well, not everyone uses flash nowadays. Speaking of that, Adobe and Google Chrome or planning to lend support for adobe flash in 2020, which will be in 2  years. According to a blog on the Google call chrome blog, google was announcing that adobe planter and support for adobe flash in chrome, which will be at the end of 2020, which isn't too long. Also, not only were they are software files that I shared, but there were some audio recordings. There was one recording that I share that I had on my phone call me and papa talking and telling some stories. I was texting you that file to people, like Dad, Grandma, and especially popular, since he lives on this recording as well. And many many many more. Another Voice Memos recording I did was around October, when me, mom, dad and my sister were playing games like Simon says, playing bop it and stuff. I was texting that to mom and dad because I figure they would like to download this file house it was cool. I also shared it to Grandma and some others, so they could have a taste of what we did. How about that? Speaking of Google plus, sometimes I look around and see all the cool posts I've done over the years, and there have been some from this year too. Some of them were questions, some of them were links to download or view videos, some of them were just discussing things, and a lot of stuff that I had posted over last year and this year. The first ever post I made on there was a post of an episode of Microsoft Sam reads random windows errors. Other with things include websites to videos and other stuff, and much more to say. I would want to post I did which I think it was on Monday when I discussed about Amazon Music, and some songs you could listen to on your free plan. One of the things I talked about with Kevin McLeod, as he doesn't have much to discover for the full three plans. Are used to have his Christmas songs, like jingle bells. Apparently, you have to get primed to listen to that again because apparently, it's not like that anymore. Another way I knew it because one time I downloaded it, and when I checked it wasn't available. I also talked about monster cat, and Cal some of their songs want and how there were some limiting albums to choose from. Also, the thing that's kind of bad is, the new albums from monster cock, like the monster cat on cage albums, like the Monstercat uncaged volume one through four, you can't see it yet. Speaking of that, the monster cub uncaged volume for was really the first day of the month, so yeah. Also, another thing I was talking about with Pandora. Kevin McLeod is also not on there at all, even if you tell your Amazon echo to create a station with that person, or if you search your mom there. Yeah, and surprisingly, none of his tracks for on there. I wonder if they even had his tracks up on there or not, since they don't have any of his stuff on there at all. It's also surprising do to a person who quiet but about everybody knows, since I wanna people know who this person is, and what he makes. So that's another surprising thing. However, he is available with Google play music, so that's at least good. That was one of the things I was discussing, because I haven't talked about that on there at all, so I thought I would talk about it for a bit and explain to some people and tell them that some of her stuff is not there. I'm sure some people are aware of that, and they probably know that as well. That's why I decided to discuss about it. Also, yesterday since I still had that problem with uploading the iMovie slideshow video, I also decided to post about it too just in case someone else ever had that problem with the new version of iMovie. I'm not sure if I exactly know, but if they do then that's good. I also posted the screenshot, that level can take a look at what the heck is going on with that stuff. Like I said before, that should be working Doppler and what it supposed to be doing. Apparently, it isn't really doing its job, which definitely isn't OK. It should be uploading just fine, but it just wanted to be crappy not do what it supposed to do! Hopefully I can get the project out soon, that way everybody can see it. The good news is that I still have a lot of subscribers. I told mom about me getting that much subscribers, and she was asking how are you getting all those subscribers? I thought it was kind of a crazy question, because people can discover you and they couldn't find your stuff and they might enjoy it. So I Kinda didn't say much because I figured I should cowboy would know this answer by now. Who knows, I guess she's having a duh moment, because even I would know that answer. I think she should know that answer as well, because public channels to be discovered any time, so what the heck? Not only that but sometimes I try to share the channel 12 many people and sometimes get tags on my videos, and I think tag is it good for videos as people will be able to see it by searching that tag. That's why I add tags. Not only do I add tags and videos, but I also add tags in the description box, not just the tag form. As much as you enter, and all you have to do is have someone type in a keyword of a tag that I made, or type in a keyword that use the tag for, and maybe it just light show your video! If it does, awesome! If it doesn't, oh well just keep searching. In some cases, in my talk show episodes I might even add times from what I've been talking about. This way people will be able to see it that way when I do this. What do you think about that idea? I think it's a pretty good one. If it's a technology talk, maybe I might say technology, apps, or if I'm talking about balloons, maybe I might add that is a tag. If I'm never talking about text to speech, I might add that of the tag, because that's one of the things I talk about, so sometimes I might add that of a tag for a video. That's why I try to include tags and videos, as it helps people find your stuff there. In the tag foreman you to make website, it says "tags help me worse find your videos and discover your channel. Want to add some tags? Then, that's the form where you want to add tags in. That's where I am there's times from. Also, the tutorial video that I talk about, that was one of the things I said was to add tags in those videos, they might help you find more people and get more subscribers to if you didn't ever know that. Well, that's a pretty easy tip there. Sometimes, when I release helium balloons I might target helium balloon releases, or maybe blue releases instead. If they search for helium balloon releases, then some of my content lotta pier. But you have two gig, as there might be a lot of videos that will appear with that keyword. If I am never doing the flying disc resume launcher, I might target flying desk, or pull string helicopter or something. Sometimes if I give my talk show, I also might Taggett the Bryce talkshow, just for my own new thing. That way my episodes of appear using the keyword if you type it in. The next time I do my talk show episode, I should discuss the first part I talked about on this which is about freezing up your iPhone by copying so many texts and pasting it somewhere. I'm not sure if I will be able to take a screenshot to include in the video, is it like not let me do that. It would probably be to lag he can even take a screenshot of what's going on anyway, so who knows. I haven't really tried that out, but my theory is it might not take it because it would be lagging a lot, and it might be slow to take a screenshot of what's going on the screen when your phone is like that, so we have to try that out and see what happens if it never freezes like that. Remember, sometimes I might copy a lot, and if that's the case then sometimes it probably wouldn't let me do anything like send something. Most cases, if I'm in the Messages app, I might play something like it saying copied the pasteboard copied the baseboard or something, with a bunch of characters. If you even try to send it, most cases it might even make the app crash, and you have to restart the app again. Like I told you, one time when I try to do that on Google plus, it made the webpage crash and reload, and when I clicked on post it never was able to post the post because it was too much and it refreshed. So, that could mean that it was about ready to crash on you. I would figure that out with the patron refresh if you came across the post, but it never actually posted what I had pasted in. But I figured it probably would not do that, is the phone would could only handle so much that it decides to do some crazy things like crash on your refresh the page, which is what happened on Tuesday when I tried it, and that's exactly what happened. So, that plan failed as it did that exactly. I'm also planning to activate office 365 sometime, except I wouldn't give my iTunes card to do that. If you're wondering how I could do that, it would be by using the OneDrive app. This part is where you can delete an app purchase instead of going into the website for Microsoft in doing it. This way you can use her own iTunes account to purchase it, and it also gives you office teachers as well, and will also give you more storage. You will also be able to use all the other office programs, and you'll be able to access it. To show you that you can purchase it using the app, on Monday I have taken a screenshot that shows you that you can purchase it using the app. Here, I'll show you.

In fact, it shows that you get premium features as well, including storage, which means you can have all the storage, which is one terabyte. So not only will you get off of speakers, but you can also be able to use the office programs like excel, PowerPoint and Microsoft word program. Not only that, there's also a thing called office online, which really isn't good for Screenwitter support, because it doesn't read everything that you type in if you're using Microsoft word online. The Microsoft office online includes all the office programs in there, so you can use Excel, PowerPoint and word all on the website, and you can just use that if you want. But for me, I think it would be best if I had the programs, but I probably have to still make sure that's what I would want to do, and I'd have to explore the website more because you know I might even like it, but it kind of stinks right now and it sometimes doesn't do all that other stuff. However, I'm sure they probably still useful if you ever try it out. However, I'm sure for some of you are you probably be able to figure it out in no time. The cool thing though about the website is it has all of the office towards that you can use. So if you don't want to spend any money on it, you can use the online site if you want. Currently that's what I've been doing right now, since I don't have it activated yet. Hopefully soon I can get it activated so I can use it. This is because it's probably better than giving up on the programs than using it on the site, is it white and even give you more features if you activate it probably if I had to guess. I'm pretty sure that's what it would do. Another thing I sometimes get on the computer right things and not pad, which is also a simple thing to go on to write stuff on. There's not much they can do like the other programs, but at least it is pretty better though. There are a lot of times where I go and you said, and sometimes I go on there. But maybe not all the time, but there are might be time for I go on the program and put things on it. There's not much things to say besides the word wrap and stuff like that, but at least it's pretty good, although it probably doesn't offer a lot though. I would use it just like I use my phone to write stuff and talk about different things, just like I do using this one. Then you can save it to wherever you want, I would probably save it in my documents folder, but she's all my documents and different things on it, and maybe webpages or Internet shortcuts. Speaking of arriving, there was a document that I created using Google Docs that talks about a timeline story when I played with the flying disc resume launcher. This document tells you everything from when I started to play with them, torn Ifirst got one which was two years ago, and what I do with them now, and how fun it is. I still currently have this file, and I have some pictures of it. I also talk about how I do in the basement now, as the walls are painted in the family room, which was the best place to do it up, because it had a high ceiling in the results and stuff to hit with. Especially the big one because it not the candle down, which is very bad because it probably almost broke it, hopefully not as grandma would probably be mad. You know how she probably would be. One time it happened with me and Dad played with it, and it hit the candle, and as you know me, I was laughing about it and schedule, because I laugh at stuff like that all the time. Sometimes when I listen to the recording I would laugh at it because I would think you'll be so funny to listen to it fall down, and I would laugh at it every time. Speaking of that toy, when I play with it Friday, I also got some pictures that Grandma took of me playing with it. I'll show you those pictures as well.

This time, me and Grandma decided that we would do it in the hallway and see how cold it would be. We were there probably like an hour or so messing around, and we were having fun doing it. When I first started doing it, I was standing up because I figured it was probably high ceiling which it was, but not as high as the family room. One time I shot it and it hit the chandelier that shut it. Also Dad was asleep, so I thought you know I better sit down and do it, because if I hit the chandelier too much it might fall down, and we don't want that to happen at all. Even Grandma thought that was so crazy. So then, I just sat down and did it. After Grandma is done taking videos, she also took pictures of me flying it, which I also inserted into my slideshow, I mean my video on Friday. I haven't shared it to my slideshow yet, as I'm pretty much done with that project. All I need to do is share that if it will work. After the videos were Sean, before the end of the video showed some pictures that Grandma took. Then I saved it all in that thing. I decided to add the pictures at the end of the video, at least it was adding it to the end of the video not the first part of the video, because that's not where I wanted it to go, because I wanted it to match that so I decided to have it done the end of the video and I have some pictures there. You will also know that there's picture of because when you rub photos, in iMovie the music gets louder for some reason, and does not get louder any other time when there is a video playing or if there's audio and the video. I don't know why that is, but I know it does that. However it was still a good video, and I was actually glad that it actually manage to upload like it was supposed to, unlike that of a project that I'm kind of mad ad because it would not go away supposed to do. I certainly hope that issue will be taken care of, because I still want to sure that slideshow if I can. If I can share the slideshows, that will be good because then it will work. If not, well, I'll probably have to call we re-created, will probably delete the project because it won't be able to share there, but at least I can still play the video though. I wonder if it will let me save it to iCloud Drive, because I could probably do it there. Better do that, otherwise it's grounded. Just kidding, you can't ground a nap, that's not either way possible. It will be crazy because it would be possible. If I Mabel to share the video, I'll let you guys see if it works. I swear, it better start working because otherwise it has something coming for them, and I promise you, that happens, it will be very sorry that it did not work like it was supposed to, instead it was doing what it wasn't supposed to be doing. Worth slideshow that I ever did which is on August 1 was the first ever slideshow video that I posted to YouTube. Hopefully if it works it will be my second slideshow video, but for now it's not gonna work so far and hasn't done it's job which is never good. Well, that is pretty much what I have to say for today. I think this is probably the most long one that I wrote, as all my other gnosis not so long like this, as there probably like 20 minutes or so, but this one is quite good. I hope you will like it, and all reminders to see you guys sometime later. Yes my even be posted on Google plus, and it might be the longest thing that I've ever posted on it too, because I haven't posted something like that ever. There was one note that I uploaded Liswell about me on the walkie-talkie when I talked about it, but that pre-much was it. Why ever put it on Google plus, it will be probably noticed the longest plus post long in history, if no one probably ever posted something long like that before, so that'll be interesting. I also hope my photos will be on there too, otherwise somebody's in trouble.
